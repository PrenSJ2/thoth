## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Setup Required" Notification

**Problem**: You see a notification saying "Please configure your API keys"

**Solution**: Open the Thoth popup and save your OpenAI and GitHub API keys

### No Sources or Repositories Showing

**Problem**: No sources appear after clicking "Load Organizations & User" or no repositories in context menu

**Solution**:
- Verify your GitHub token has the correct scopes (`repo`, `read:org`)
- Make sure you've selected at least one source checkbox in the popup
- Check the repo count message at the bottom of the sources section
- Try refreshing sources by clicking "Refresh Sources"
- Open the browser console (F12) and check for error messages

### "Failed to create issue" Error

**Problem**: Issue creation fails with an error notification

**Solution**:
- Verify you have write access to the selected repository
- Check that both API keys are valid and not expired
- Ensure you have remaining quota on your OpenAI account
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

### Context Menu Not Appearing

**Problem**: Right-click menu doesn't show "Create GitHub Issue with AI"

**Solution**:
- Make sure you've loaded sources and selected at least one source
- Verify that repositories have been loaded (check repo count in popup)
- Reload the extension: go to `chrome://extensions/`, find Thoth, and click the refresh icon
- Try reloading the webpage you're working on

## üîß Development

### Building & Packaging

#### Local Testing

To package the extension locally for testing:

```bash
# Package the extension (creates dist/thoth-extension-v{version}.zip)
make package

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

#### Creating a Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. **Update the version** in `manifest.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.2.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Commit the change**:
   ```bash
   git add manifest.json
   git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"
   git push
   ```

3. **Create and push the release tag**:
   ```bash
   make release VERSION=1.2.0
   ```

The GitHub Action will automatically:
- Verify the manifest version matches the tag
- Package the extension
- Generate a changelog from commits
- Create a GitHub release with release notes
- Upload the `.zip` file as a downloadable asset

**View releases:** [GitHub Releases](../../releases)

#### Manual Release (if needed)

If you need to create a tag manually:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

### File Responsibilities

- **manifest.json**: Defines extension metadata, permissions, and entry points
- **background.js**: Service worker that handles:
  - Dynamic context menu creation
  - Issue template detection and fetching
  - OpenAI API calls for issue generation
  - GitHub API calls for issue creation
  - Chrome notifications
- **content.js**: Injected into web pages to capture selections and track right-clicked elements
- **popup.html/popup.js**: Extension settings interface for:
  - API key management
  - Organization and user source selection
  - Repository filtering via source checkboxes

### API Endpoints Used

**OpenAI**:
- `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini`

**GitHub**:
- `GET https://api.github.com/user` (fetch current user)
- `GET https://api.github.com/user/orgs` (fetch organizations)
- `GET https://api.github.com/users/{user}/repos?per_page=100` (fetch user repositories)
- `GET https://api.github.com/orgs/{org}/repos?per_page=100` (fetch org repositories)
- `GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` (for issue templates)
- `POST https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` (create issue)

### Issue Template Detection

Thoth automatically checks for issue templates in the following locations (in order):
1. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
2. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
3. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
4. `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
5. `.github/issue_template.md`

When a template is found, the AI uses it to structure the generated issue content, filling in sections and placeholders with relevant information from your selected content.
